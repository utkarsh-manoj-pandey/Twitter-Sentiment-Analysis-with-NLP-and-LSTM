# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with NLP and LSTM 📊🚀

Predicting sentiments in tweets using the magic of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the wizardry of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks! 🧙‍♂️✨

## Objective 🌟

Dive into the vast ocean of tweets and decipher their sentiments! This project aims to categorize tweets as "Positive," "Neutral," or "Negative" using the enchanting powers of NLP and a custom LSTM model. 🧠📈

## Dataset 📑

Behold the mystical dataset (`Twitter_Data.csv`) containing tweets and their corresponding sentiment categories:
- 0: Neutral
- -1: Negative
- 1: Positive

## Tasks 📝

1. **Data Sorcery**
   - Summon the data from the Excel file.
   - Transmute sentiment categories into categorical labels.

2. **Magical Cleaning**
   - Ward off missing values.
   - Apply ancient text-cleansing spells to remove symbols, convert to lowercase, and banish stopwords.

3. **Enchanting Text Processing**
   - Tokenize and pad text data.
   - Craft an LSTM model for sentiment analysis.

4. **Model Training Incantation**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the LSTM model on the magical training data.

5. **Performance Elevation Spell**
   - Normalize predictions and measure accuracy.
   - Unleash a classification report for detailed performance insights.
